YouGee (your veggees!) A app for connecting local gardeners and cooks!

technologies used are: HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, ruby, rails, PostgreSQL, heroku and devise

Approach taken:
Break up users into either cooks or gardeners |  |
gardeners post produce, see all their produce, and see all the posted produce from all gardeners  | |
cooks can select produce and see all their selections |  |
use devise to authenticate users and at creation assign them to either cook or gardener |  |
style with bootstrap

Installation/startup instructions:
clone or download the repo  | |
open in terminal  | |
bundle install  | |
rake db:seed  | |
rails s

Unsolved problems and next steps:
Allowing gardeners to create new produce types instead of hard coded seeds  | |
Communication between cooks and gardeners on the platform |  |
Pictures of gardeners produce |  |
